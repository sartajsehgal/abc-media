		<h1>HTML 5</h1>
		<h3>WHAT IS HTML?</h3>
		<p>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, a format for creating documents and web pages. It was originally invented in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, and was based on an earlier markup language called SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which was based on an earlier format simply called GML (Generalized Markup Language) developed at IBM in the 1960s.HTML consists primarily of matching pairs of angle-bracketed tags surrounding human-meaningful text (&lt;span&gt;like this&lt;/span&gt;). The tags provide meaning, context, and display information to the text they surround.</p>
		<h3>WHERE AND HOW IS HTML USED?</h3>
		<P>HTML is used for almost all web pages. The web page you are reading right now uses HTML. It is the default language of websites. <br> 
		It can also be used for other types of documents, like ebooks.<br>
	    HTML documents are rendered by a web browser (the application you are using to read this page). HTML rendering hides all the tags, and changes the display of the rest of the content based on what those tags say it should look like.</P>
	    <h3>WHAT ARE HTML TAGS?</h3>
	    <P>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: &lt;h1&gt;.,<br>
		Most tags must be opened &lt;h1&gt; and closed &lt;/h1&gt; in order to function</P>
		<h3>WHAT ARE HTML ATTRIBUTES?</h3>
		<P>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.<br>
		An example of an attribute is:<br>
		&lt;img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog."&gt;<br>
		In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the &lt;img&gt; tag</P>
		<h3>HOW TO MAKE A BASIC HTML PAGE?</h3>
		<P>These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.<br>
		&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.<br>
		&lt;html&gt; — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code..<br>
		&lt;head&gt; — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs..<br>
		&lt;body&gt; — This is where the content of the page goes..<br></P>

		<img src="html-homepage-layout-demo.webp">

		<p>Inside the &lt;head&gt; tag, there is one tag that is always included: &lt;title&gt;, but there are others that are just as important:<br>
		&lt;title&gt;<br>
 		This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.<br>
		&lt;meta&gt;<br>
		This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.</p>

		<h1>CSS 3</h1>
		<h3>WHAT IS CSS?</h3>
		<P>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It’s a stylesheet language that describes the appearance or presentation of a website. Essentially, CSS tells web browsers how each element in an HTML document should be displayed.<br>
		Along with JavaScript and HTML, CSS is a crucial component to every web page on the Internet.<br>
		The main benefit of CSS is the ability to separate website content from the design elements, simply by changing rules in a CSS file.</P>
		<h3>WHAT IS SYNTAX OF CSS?</h3>
		<img src="css.gif">
		<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
		The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
		Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>
		A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

		<h1>JAVASCRIPT ES6</h1>
		<h3>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?</h3>
		<P>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.<br>
		JavaScript is incredibly versatile and beginner friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</P>
